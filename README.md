# Spamector

## A Spam Detecor

- **Summary**

Text mining is a wide field which has gained popularity with the huge text data being generated. 
Automation of several applications like sentiment analysis, document classification, topic classification, text summarization, and machine translation has been done using machine learning models.

Spam filtering is an example of document classification task which involves classifying an email as spam or non-spam (a.k.a. ham) mail.

In this project, I will go through the different steps on how to implement this kind of systems in a form of a tutorial using Python, and a publicly available mail corpus.

The output would be an API and a web application allowing the user to enter a message and get a response if it's a spam or ham.
